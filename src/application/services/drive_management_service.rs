//! D2 — drive membership management service.
//!
//! Translates `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/drives/{id}/members` into role-grant
//! writes on `resource_type='drive'`, layering D2's business rules on top:
//!
//! - **Personal-drive guard** (§2): drives with `kind='personal'` are
//!   single-user single-owner by invariant; any member mutation is refused
//!   at the service edge with `403`. Listing a personal drive's members is
//!   still allowed (returns exactly the owner row) so the UI can render the
//!   same shape across drive kinds without per-kind branching.
//!
//! - **Last-owner protection** (shared drives): removing or demoting the
//!   final `Role::Owner` would leave the drive unmanageable. Refused at the
//!   service edge — the caller has to promote someone else to Owner first,
//!   or delete the drive.
//!
//! - **Authorization**: caller must hold `Permission::Manage` on the drive
//!   to mutate; `Permission::Read` to list. `AuthorizationEngine::require`
//!   emits the canonical `authz.denied` audit line on rejection.
