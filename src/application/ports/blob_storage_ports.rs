//! Blob Storage Backend Port — abstracts raw byte I/O for content-addressable storage.
//!
//! This trait decouples `DedupService` from any specific storage medium.
//! Implementations include:
//! - `LocalBlobBackend`  — local filesystem (default)
//! - `S3BlobBackend`     — any S3-compatible service (AWS, Backblaze B2, MinIO, R2…)
//!
//! `DedupService` owns an `Arc<dyn BlobStorageBackend>` and delegates all
//! byte-level I/O through this trait, keeping BLAKE3 hashing, ref-counting
//! and PostgreSQL index logic in `DedupService` itself.
