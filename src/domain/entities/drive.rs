//! Drive — the top-level container that owns a tree of folders/files.
//!
//! Drives replaced the per-user `My Folder - <username>` wrapper at D0.
//! Every folder and file row carries a `drive_id` (added by D0's
//! migration); a drive is the natural unit of quota, sharing, and
//! lifecycle. Membership is expressed through `storage.role_grants` rows
//! with `resource_type='drive'` — there is no separate `drive_members`
//! table.
//!
//! ## Kinds
//!
//! Two kinds today; the discriminant is the `kind` column with a CHECK
//! constraint.
//!
//! - **`personal`** — single-user, single-owner. The owner is captured
//!   by `default_for_user` (for the default Personal drive) or by an
//!   Owner role_grant on a secondary personal drive. Personal drives
//!   refuse `add_member`, `remove_member`, and `delete_drive` (when
//!   it's the user's only or default drive). A user can have multiple
//!   personal drives — one is marked default (`default_for_user =
//!   <uid>`), the others are secondaries (`default_for_user = NULL`,
//!   one Owner row in role_grants pinning them to the same user).
//!
//! - **`shared`** — multi-member, group-aware, full role roster
//!   (viewer / commenter / contributor / editor / owner). Members
//!   come from role_grants; group subjects expand transitively via
//!   the existing `subject_groups` machinery. Last-owner protection
//!   applies on member removal and drive deletion. Quota is set by
//!   the drive owner (or admin); `used_bytes` tracks consumption.
//!
//! Future kinds (e.g. `system` for built-in scratch space) drop in by
//! extending the CHECK + the `DriveKind` enum.
//!
//! ## Policies
//!
//! `policies` is a JSONB bag carrying feature flags / capability toggles
//! that drive owners can flip without a schema change. Known keys live in
//! `docs/plan/drive.md` §8 and §15 (e.g. `forbid_public_links`,
//! `include_in_photo_index`, `forbid_music_index`). Unknown keys are
//! preserved by the application — the schema is intentionally permissive
//! so future capability flags can land without a migration.
